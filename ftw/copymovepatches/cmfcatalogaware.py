Basically it does not an uncatalog an afterwards a catalog, but just updates
the new path where necessary. This saves us from reindexing the whole moved
structure.
Unfortunately there are several path related indexes, which needs to be update.
But so far this change means a performance boost by factor 10.

The main issue was that the searchableText from Files was indexed again.
